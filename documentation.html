        <h4 id="1.2.2" class="mt-5">1.2.2 Techniques for Ideation in Design</h4>
        <p>For our brainstorming sessions, we employed several ideation techniques, such as mind mapping, affinity diagrams, and the SCAMPER method (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse). These techniques helped us explore a wide range of possibilities and ensure that no idea was overlooked.</p>
        <p>Our two-stage approach to ideation was particularly effective for our project. By first generating a broad set of ideas and then narrowing them down, we ensured that we considered all possibilities before making any decisions. This method also allowed us to refine our concepts and focus on the most impactful solutions.</p>
        <p>Through multiple brainstorming sessions, we were able to clearly define our development goals and principles. This clarity enabled us to distribute responsibilities equitably within our team, ensuring that each member could contribute their strengths to the project.</p>

        <h4 id="1.2.3" class="mt-5">1.2.3 Primary Goals and Selection of Project Topic</h4>
        <p>Our exhibition focuses on micrographs of the human body. Initially, we considered including images of the broader biological world. However, after thorough brainstorming, we decided that concentrating on the human body would be more impactful for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Familiarity:</strong> Many people have a basic understanding of the human body. Iconic educational cartoons like "Il était une fois... la Vie" (Once Upon a Time... Life) and the anime "Cells at Work!" have popularized the subject.</li>
            <li><strong>Educational Relevance:</strong> The human body is a topic covered in primary and high school curricula, making it familiar to a broad audience, including medical students.</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Connection:</strong> People tend to be more interested in the human body because it directly relates to themselves.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="1.2.4" class="mt-5">1.2.4 Popularity of the Human Body as a Topic</h4>
        <p>Statistics show that the human body is a popular topic of interest. According to Google Trends, search queries related to human anatomy and physiology consistently rank higher than other biology topics. Educational platforms like Khan Academy and Coursera report higher enrollment numbers for courses on human biology compared to general biology courses. Additionally, children's educational programming featuring the human body garners significant viewership, indicating a widespread interest across age groups.</p>
        <p>By focusing on the human body, we aim to leverage this inherent interest to create a compelling and educational exhibition that resonates with a wide audience.</p>

        <h4 id="1.2.5" class="mt-5">1.2.5 Assigning Responsibilities</h4>
        <p>When dividing responsibilities, we adhered to a single principle: not to separate by techniques, but to share by functionality. This approach was crucial for us, as it ensured that every team member was involved in the application's development, thereby enhancing their hard skills.</p>
        <p>By dividing responsibilities based on pages rather than specific tasks, we ensured comprehensive involvement across all aspects of the project. This method facilitated a more integrated and holistic development process.</p>

        <h4 id="1.2.6" class="mt-5">1.2.6 Team Responsibilities</h4>

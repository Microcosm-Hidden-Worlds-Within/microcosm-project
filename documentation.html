        </ul>

        <h4 id="1.1.3" class="mt-5">1.1.3 Objectives</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Educational Value:</strong> Provide detailed information and context about each image to enhance understanding of microscopic structures and their significance in human biology.</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Experience:</strong> Utilize web technologies to create an interactive and immersive exhibition that encourages exploration and curiosity.</li>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>Welcome to a world where the unseen becomes visible, and every image tells a story.</strong></p>

        <h3 id="1.2" class="mt-5">1.2 Idea Development</h3>
        <p>We began our project with a comprehensive brainstorming session, focusing on the most critical aspects of web development. Our approach was rooted in an iterative design process. Utilizing notes for publication, we brainstormed and gathered intriguing ideas.</p>
        <p>This cycle was split into two phases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the first phase, we generated a wide array of ideas.</li>
            <li>In the second phase, we organized and selected the most promising ones.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="1.2.1" class="mt-5">1.2.1 Brainstorming Categories</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Information Architecture:</strong> We considered how to structure and present information effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>General Graphic Design:</strong> We explored various visual styles and design principles.</li>
            <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> We designed for both desktop and mobile applications.</li>
            <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> We focused on creating an intuitive and engaging experience for our users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="1.2.2" class="mt-5">1.2.2 Techniques for Ideation in Design</h4>
        <p>For our brainstorming sessions, we employed several ideation techniques, such as mind mapping, affinity diagrams, and the SCAMPER method (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse). These techniques helped us explore a wide range of possibilities and ensure that no idea was overlooked.</p>
        <p>Our two-stage approach to ideation was particularly effective for our project. By first generating a broad set of ideas and then narrowing them down, we ensured that we considered all possibilities before making any decisions. This method also allowed us to refine our concepts and focus on the most impactful solutions.</p>
        <p>Through multiple brainstorming sessions, we were able to clearly define our development goals and principles. This clarity enabled us to distribute responsibilities equitably within our team, ensuring that each member could contribute their strengths to the project.</p>

        <h4 id="1.2.3" class="mt-5">1.2.3 Primary Goals and Selection of Project Topic</h4>
        <p>Our exhibition focuses on micrographs of the human body. Initially, we considered including images of the broader biological world. However, after thorough brainstorming, we decided that concentrating on the human body would be more impactful for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Familiarity:</strong> Many people have a basic understanding of the human body. Iconic educational cartoons like "Il était une fois... la Vie" (Once Upon a Time... Life) and the anime "Cells at Work!" have popularized the subject.</li>
            <li><strong>Educational Relevance:</strong> The human body is a topic covered in primary and high school curricula, making it familiar to a broad audience, including medical students.</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Connection:</strong> People tend to be more interested in the human body because it directly relates to themselves.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="1.2.4" class="mt-5">1.2.4 Popularity of the Human Body as a Topic</h4>
        <p>Statistics show that the human body is a popular topic of interest. According to Google Trends, search queries related to human anatomy and physiology consistently rank higher than other biology topics. Educational platforms like Khan Academy and Coursera report higher enrollment numbers for courses on human biology compared to general biology courses. Additionally, children's educational programming featuring the human body garners significant viewership, indicating a widespread interest across age groups.</p>
        <p>By focusing on the human body, we aim to leverage this inherent interest to create a compelling and educational exhibition that resonates with a wide audience.</p>

        <h4 id="1.2.5" class="mt-5">1.2.5 Assigning Responsibilities</h4>
        <p>When dividing responsibilities, we adhered to a single principle: not to separate by techniques, but to share by functionality. This approach was crucial for us, as it ensured that every team member was involved in the application's development, thereby enhancing their hard skills.</p>
        <p>By dividing responsibilities based on pages rather than specific tasks, we ensured comprehensive involvement across all aspects of the project. This method facilitated a more integrated and holistic development process.</p>

        <h4 id="1.2.6" class="mt-5">1.2.6 Team Responsibilities</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ludovica Benini and Alberto Ciarrocca:</strong> Responsible for the complete application development, encompassing everything from design to the creation of application navigation algorithms.</li>
            <li><strong>Simone Casazza and Anna Pak:</strong> Tasked with developing the narrative page and the map page.</li>
            <li><strong>Entire Team:</strong> Collaboratively developed the home page, ensuring a unified and cohesive entry point for the website.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2 id="4" class="mt-5">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Our web-based exhibition, <strong>Microcosm: Hidden Worlds Within</strong>, at Palazzo Pepoli reflects a careful blend of design principles, technical strategies, and content organization, creating a seamless and engaging user experience. Our focus on minimalistic design, effective storytelling, and efficient data management ensures that the exhibition is both visually appealing and easy to navigate.</p>

      <h3 id="4.1" class="mt-5">Design Principles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Color Scheme:</strong> We use a minimalistic palette of white (#fff), black (#000000), and red (#cc1b1b). White and black provide neutral backgrounds that enhance the vibrant microscopic images, while red is used sparingly for emphasis, evoking the color of blood and drawing attention.</li>
        <li><strong>Typography:</strong> We chose Montserrat, a geometric sans-serif typeface, for its readability and modern look. Sourced from Google Fonts, it is used in Regular and Semi-Bold weights to create a clear visual hierarchy.</li>
        <li><strong>Layout and Grid System:</strong> Our layout uses a 12-column grid structure, ensuring alignment and consistent spacing. Responsive design principles adapt the layout to different screen sizes, enhancing usability across devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Iconography and Imagery:</strong> Outline-style icons aid navigation, and the 19 microscopic images serve as both exhibition objects and design elements, adding color and interest.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="4.2" class="mt-5">Content Organization</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Narrative Structure:</strong> Our storytelling approach guides users through the exhibition, allowing exploration of various narratives and sub-narratives via interconnected pages.</li>
        <li><strong>User Pathways:</strong> Multiple pathways, including the main exhibition page, narrative page, and map page, provide flexibility and enhance the user's exploration experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Visual Design:</strong> White backgrounds on most pages ensure optimal content contrast, while a black background on the exhibition page highlights the primary content. Black text is used for readability, with red for emphasis. Interactive elements like buttons are red, turning white with red text and borders on hover for accessibility.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="4.3" class="mt-5">Data Organization</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>JSON Structure:</strong> JSON files facilitate dynamic content generation and efficient data management. Data is organized into picData and subjectData sections, with objects ordered by dimension in micrometers (µm).</li>
        <li><strong>Narratives JSON:</strong> A separate JSON file contains narrative information, ensuring the website is reusable, with only the homepage and about us page requiring manual updates.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="4.4" class="mt-5">Location of Exhibition</h3>
      <p>The exhibition is hosted at Palazzo Pepoli, a Baroque palace in central Bologna, Italy. Its convenient location, suitable dimensions for our images, and simple architectural structure make it an ideal venue. The map page provides a constant reference to the layout of Palazzo Pepoli, enhancing navigational experience.</p>

      <h3 id="4.5" class="mt-5">Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>In conclusion, our project highlights the thoughtful integration of design principles, technical strategies, and content organization to create a compelling and user-friendly exhibition. The minimalistic design keeps the focus on the vibrant microscopic images, while well-structured JSON data ensures dynamic content generation and easy maintenance. By considering every aspect of design and data organization, we have created an exhibition that is visually engaging, easy to navigate, and fully reusable for future projects. This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the intricacies of <strong>Microcosm: Hidden Worlds Within</strong> and the rationale behind each design and technical decision.</p>

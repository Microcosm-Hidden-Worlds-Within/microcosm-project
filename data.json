      "Lithography is a printing process that involves etching a drawing onto a limestone or treated metal plate. This method allows for the creation of images with a remarkable amount of detail and shading, essential for conveying the complex structures observed under a microscope. The technique exploits the principle that oil and water do not mix: the drawing is traced with an oily substance on a treated surface, then the stone is moistened, and subsequently, ink is applied that adheres only to the oily parts of the drawing."

The human proximal tubule is a critical segment of the nephron in the kidney, essential for reabsorbing water, ions, and nutrients from the glomerular filtrate back into the bloodstream. It plays a vital role in maintaining bodily homeostasis and regulating fluid and electrolyte balance.",
    "longerInfo": [
      "The human proximal tubule is a key component of the nephron, situated in the renal cortex and extending into the medulla. It begins at the Bowman's capsule, where initial ultrafiltration of blood plasma occurs, and continues into the medulla, connecting to the loop of Henle.", "Microscopically, the proximal tubule is lined with a single layer of epithelial cells that are rich in microvilli, forming a brush border. This structural feature significantly increases the surface area of the tubule, facilitating the reabsorption of water, electrolytes (such as sodium, potassium, chloride), glucose, amino acids, and other solutes from the filtrate.", "Epithelial cells of the proximal tubule are metabolically active, evidenced by the abundance of mitochondria, necessary to support energy-demanding transport processes. These cells perform active transport to selectively reabsorb essential substances while allowing waste products and excess ions to be excreted in urine.", "Functionally, the proximal tubule is divided into two main segments: the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) and the straight proximal tubule (PST). The PCT, characterized by its highly convoluted structure near the Bowman's capsule, maximizes surface area for efficient reabsorption. In contrast, the PST descends into the medulla, where it continues reabsorption and prepares the filtrate for further concentration in the loop of Henle."

      <h5>Anatomy of Human Hair</h5>
      <p><strong>Human hair</strong> is a filamentous biomaterial that grows from follicles found in the dermis. It is primarily composed of a protein called keratin, which is also found in nails and the outer layer of skin. Each strand of hair has three main parts: the cuticle, the cortex, and the medulla.</p>
      <p>The <strong>cuticle</strong> is the outermost layer, consisting of overlapping scale-like cells that protect the inner layers. The <strong>cortex</strong> is the middle layer, which contains the fibrous proteins and melanin that give hair its strength, elasticity, and color. The <strong>medulla</strong> is the innermost layer, which may or may not be present in all hair types and is composed of a soft, spongy mass of tissue.</p>
      
      <h5>Growth Cycle</h5>
      <p>Human hair grows in a cycle that includes three main phases: anagen, catagen, and telogen. The <strong>anagen phase</strong> is the active growth phase, during which the hair follicle produces new cells. This phase can last between two to six years. The <strong>catagen phase</strong> is a transitional phase that lasts about two to three weeks. During this phase, hair growth stops, and the outer root sheath shrinks and attaches to the root of the hair. The <strong>telogen phase</strong> is the resting phase, which lasts about three months, after which the hair falls out and a new hair begins to grow in its place.</p>
      
      <h5>Hair Types</h5>
      <p>Human hair can be classified into different types based on its texture and curl pattern. The four main types are straight, wavy, curly, and coily. Each type has unique characteristics and requires different care and maintenance. Straight hair is typically more resilient and less prone to frizz, while curly and coily hair tends to be more fragile and prone to dryness.</p>
  
      <h5>Color and Pigmentation</h5>
      <p>The color of human hair is determined by the amount and type of melanin present in the cortex. There are two types of melanin: eumelanin and pheomelanin. <strong>Eumelanin</strong> is responsible for black and brown hair colors, while <strong>pheomelanin</strong> produces red and blonde shades. The combination and concentration of these pigments result in the wide variety of hair colors seen in humans. As people age, the production of melanin decreases, leading to gray or white hair.</p>
      
      <h5>Hair Health and Split Ends</h5>
      <p>Healthy hair is characterized by its shine, smooth texture, and elasticity. However, various factors such as environmental exposure, heat styling, chemical treatments, and improper care can damage hair, leading to issues like dryness, brittleness, and split ends. <strong>Split ends</strong>, also known as trichoptilosis, occur when the protective cuticle is worn away at the ends of the hair, causing the hair to split into two or more strands. Regular trimming and proper hair care can help prevent and manage split ends.</p>
  
      <h5>Scientific and Medical Relevance</h5>
      <p>Hair is not only of cosmetic and cultural importance but also has scientific and medical relevance. Hair analysis can provide valuable information about an individual's health, nutritional status, and exposure to environmental toxins. Conditions such as alopecia, hirsutism, and hypertrichosis are related to abnormal hair growth and can have significant psychological and social impacts on affected individuals.</p>

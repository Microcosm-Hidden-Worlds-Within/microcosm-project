      <p><strong>Collagen</strong> is the most abundant protein in the human body, constituting about 25% to 35% of the whole-body protein content. It is primarily found in the extracellular matrix of various connective tissues. This structural protein is essential for maintaining the integrity, flexibility, and strength of tissues and organs.</p>

      <h5>Types of Collagen</h5>
      <p>There are at least 28 different types of collagen identified, but the majority of the collagen in the human body consists of Types I, II, and III. Each type has a distinct role and location:</p>
      <p><strong>Type I Collagen</strong> is the most prevalent form, found in skin, tendon, vasculature, organs, and bone (where it is the main component of the organic part). It provides tensile strength and is essential for the repair and maintenance of these tissues.</p>
      <p><strong>Type II Collagen</strong> is predominantly found in cartilage, providing structural support and tensile strength. It is crucial for the proper function of joints and the skeletal system.</p>
      <p><strong>Type III Collagen</strong> is found in the reticular fibers of the skin, blood vessels, and internal organs. It often works alongside Type I collagen to provide structural integrity and elasticity.</p>

      <h5>Synthesis of Collagen</h5>
      <p>The synthesis of collagen involves several steps, beginning within the cell and concluding in the extracellular space. Collagen synthesis can be divided into two main phases: intracellular and extracellular.</p>
      <p>During the <strong>intracellular phase</strong>, collagen is synthesized as a precursor called procollagen. This precursor undergoes post-translational modifications, including hydroxylation and glycosylation. These modifications are vital for the stability of the collagen triple helix structure.</p>
      <p>In the <strong>extracellular phase</strong>, procollagen is cleaved by specific enzymes to form mature collagen. The collagen molecules then spontaneously assemble into fibrils, which further aggregate into fibers. These fibers provide the structural framework for connective tissues.</p>

      <h5>Functions of Collagen</h5>
      <p>Collagen performs several crucial functions in the human body:</p>
      <p><strong>Structural Support:</strong> Collagen provides structural support to various tissues and organs, maintaining their shape and strength.</p>
      <p><strong>Elasticity:</strong> Collagen fibers contribute to the elasticity of tissues, allowing them to stretch and return to their original shape. This is particularly important in skin, blood vessels, and lungs.</p>
      <p><strong>Tissue Repair:</strong> Collagen is integral to the wound healing process. It forms a scaffold for new tissue growth and helps repair damaged tissues.</p>

      <h5>Collagen and Aging</h5>
      <p>As humans age, collagen production naturally decreases. This reduction leads to a decrease in the structural integrity and elasticity of tissues, contributing to common signs of aging such as wrinkles, joint pain, and reduced skin elasticity.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, factors such as UV radiation, smoking, and poor nutrition can accelerate collagen degradation, exacerbating the effects of aging on connective tissues.</p>

      <h5>Medical and Cosmetic Applications</h5>
      <p>Collagen is widely used in both medical and cosmetic fields due to its biocompatibility and beneficial properties. Medically, collagen is used in wound dressings, tissue regeneration, and as a scaffold for tissue engineering. It plays a vital role in the development of artificial skin, tendons, and other prosthetic materials.</p>
      <p>In the cosmetic industry, collagen supplements and injections are popular for their potential to reduce wrinkles and improve skin texture. These products aim to restore the skin's natural elasticity and firmness by enhancing the body's collagen levels.</p>

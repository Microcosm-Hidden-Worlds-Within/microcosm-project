      <h5>Structure and Location</h5>
      <p>The <strong>alveoli</strong> are tiny, balloon-like structures located at the end of the bronchioles within the lungs. Each lung contains approximately 300 million alveoli, which collectively provide a vast surface area for gas exchange. The alveoli are clustered in groups called alveolar sacs, which resemble clusters of grapes. The walls of the alveoli are extremely thin, typically only one cell thick, allowing for efficient diffusion of gases.</p>
      <p>Alveoli are surrounded by a network of <strong>capillaries</strong>, the smallest blood vessels in the body. These capillaries are also only one cell thick, ensuring minimal distance between the air in the alveoli and the blood in the capillaries. This close proximity is crucial for the rapid exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and the bloodstream.</p>

      <h5>Function</h5>
      <p>The primary function of the alveoli is to facilitate the exchange of gases between the air and the blood. When air is inhaled, it travels down the respiratory tract and reaches the alveoli, where <strong>oxygen</strong> from the air diffuses across the alveolar membrane and into the blood. Simultaneously, <strong>carbon dioxide</strong>, a waste product of metabolism, diffuses from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled.</p>
      <p>This gas exchange process is driven by differences in partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the alveolar air and the blood. The high surface area and thin walls of the alveoli ensure that this process occurs efficiently and effectively, meeting the bodyâ€™s metabolic needs.</p>

      <h5>Cell Types</h5>
      <p>The walls of the alveoli are composed of two main types of cells: <strong>Type I</strong> and <strong>Type II alveolar cells</strong>. Type I alveolar cells, also known as pneumocytes, make up about 95% of the alveolar surface area. These cells are extremely thin, facilitating the easy diffusion of gases. Type II alveolar cells are less numerous and are responsible for the production and secretion of <strong>surfactant</strong>, a substance that reduces surface tension within the alveoli and prevents them from collapsing.</p>
      <p>In addition to these cells, the alveoli also contain <strong>alveolar macrophages</strong>, which are immune cells that ingest and destroy pathogens and debris. These macrophages play a crucial role in protecting the lungs from infection and maintaining the sterility of the alveolar environment.</p>

      <h5>Surfactant and Surface Tension</h5>
      <p>Surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins secreted by Type II alveolar cells. Its primary function is to reduce the <strong>surface tension</strong> of the fluid lining the alveoli. Surface tension is the force exerted by the liquid molecules at the surface, which can cause the alveoli to collapse if not regulated. By reducing surface tension, surfactant ensures that the alveoli remain open and capable of gas exchange.</p>
      <p>The presence of surfactant is particularly important during exhalation when the alveoli are at their smallest size and most at risk of collapsing. In premature infants, the lack of sufficient surfactant can lead to <strong>respiratory distress syndrome</strong>, highlighting the critical role of this substance in lung function.</p>

      <h5>Blood Supply</h5>
      <p>The alveoli are richly supplied with blood through the <strong>pulmonary circulation</strong>. Deoxygenated blood is carried from the right ventricle of the heart to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries. These arteries branch extensively within the lungs to form a dense network of capillaries around the alveoli. Once gas exchange has occurred, the now oxygenated blood is carried back to the left atrium of the heart through the pulmonary veins.</p>
      <p>This close association between the alveoli and the pulmonary capillaries ensures that the blood is efficiently oxygenated and that carbon dioxide is effectively removed from the bloodstream, maintaining the body's homeostasis.</p>

      <h5>Pathologies</h5>
      <p>Several pathological conditions can affect the alveoli, impairing their function and compromising gas exchange. <strong>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</strong>, which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema, is characterized by damage to the alveoli and the small airways. In emphysema, the walls of the alveoli are destroyed, reducing the surface area for gas exchange and leading to difficulty in breathing.</p>
      <p><strong>Pneumonia</strong>, an infection of the lungs, can cause inflammation and fluid accumulation in the alveoli, interfering with oxygen uptake. <strong>Pulmonary edema</strong>, often a result of heart failure, involves the accumulation of fluid in the alveoli, also hindering gas exchange. Understanding the structure and function of the alveoli is essential for diagnosing and treating these and other respiratory conditions.</p>

      <p>The human eye is a complex organ that allows for the sense of vision. It consists of multiple parts, each playing a crucial role in the process of seeing. The main components include the cornea, lens, retina, and optic nerve, among others. Together, these structures work to focus light, convert it into electrical signals, and send these signals to the brain for interpretation.</p>
      
      <h5>External Structures</h5>
      
      <p><strong>Cornea:</strong> The cornea is the transparent, dome-shaped surface that covers the front of the eye. It provides a protective barrier against dirt, germs, and other particles, and contributes significantly to the eyeâ€™s overall optical power by refracting light that enters the eye.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Sclera:</strong> The sclera is the white, opaque part of the eye. It surrounds the cornea and helps maintain the eye's shape. It also provides a sturdy attachment for the extraocular muscles, which are responsible for eye movement.</p>
      
      <h5>Internal Structures</h5>
      
      <p><strong>Lens:</strong> Located directly behind the iris, the lens is a transparent, biconvex structure. It works in conjunction with the cornea to focus light on the retina. The lens can change its shape to adjust focus, a process known as accommodation.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Iris and Pupil:</strong> The iris is the colored part of the eye, which controls the size of the pupil. The pupil is the black circular opening in the center of the iris that regulates the amount of light entering the eye. In bright light, the pupil constricts to reduce light intake; in dim light, it dilates to allow more light in.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Retina:</strong> The retina is the innermost layer of the eye, which contains photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) that detect light. Rods are responsible for vision in low light conditions, while cones detect color and provide sharp central vision. The retina converts light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain via the optic nerve.</p>
      
      <h5>Support Structures</h5>
      
      <p><strong>Aqueous Humor:</strong> This clear fluid fills the space between the cornea and the lens, known as the anterior chamber. It helps maintain intraocular pressure, provides nutrients to the eye, and removes metabolic wastes.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Vitreous Humor:</strong> The vitreous humor is a gel-like substance that fills the large space between the lens and the retina, known as the vitreous chamber. It helps maintain the eye's shape and provides a pathway for light to reach the retina.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Choroid:</strong> The choroid is a layer of blood vessels and connective tissue between the sclera and the retina. It supplies oxygen and nutrients to the outer layers of the retina.</p>
      
      <h5>Visual Pathway</h5>
      
      <p><strong>Optic Nerve:</strong> The optic nerve transmits visual information from the retina to the brain. Each eye has an optic nerve, which carries the signals to the optic chiasm, where some of the nerve fibers cross to the opposite side of the brain.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Optic Chiasm and Tract:</strong> At the optic chiasm, the nerve fibers from the nasal half of each retina cross to the opposite side, while the fibers from the temporal half remain on the same side. This arrangement allows visual information from both eyes to be processed by both hemispheres of the brain.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Lateral Geniculate Nucleus:</strong> The optic tract fibers synapse at the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus. The LGN acts as a relay station, processing and transmitting visual information to the primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe of the brain.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Primary Visual Cortex:</strong> Located in the occipital lobe, the primary visual cortex (V1) is responsible for processing visual stimuli. It interprets basic visual information such as orientation, movement, and spatial frequency, and relays this information to other areas of the brain for further processing and perception.</p>

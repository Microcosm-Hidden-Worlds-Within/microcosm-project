      <p>Intestinal villi are tiny, finger-like projections found on the inner surface of the small intestine. They play a crucial role in the digestive system by increasing the surface area available for nutrient absorption. These structures are essential for efficient nutrient uptake from the digestive tract into the bloodstream.</p>
      
      <h5>Structure</h5>
      <p>The villi are covered by a layer of <strong>epithelial cells</strong> and extend into the lumen of the small intestine. Each villus measures approximately 0.5 to 1.6 millimeters in length and is about 0.1 to 0.2 millimeters in diameter. The surface of each villus is lined with <strong>microvilli</strong>, which further amplify the absorptive surface area. Together, these microvilli form what is known as the <strong>brush border</strong>, enhancing the efficiency of nutrient absorption.</p>
      
      <h5>Histology</h5>
      <p>Histologically, each villus is composed of a core of <strong>loose connective tissue</strong> called the lamina propria, which contains various cell types including <strong>fibroblasts</strong>, <strong>macrophages</strong>, and <strong>lymphocytes</strong>. The lamina propria houses a network of <strong>capillaries</strong> and <strong>lacteals</strong> (lymphatic vessels), which are essential for transporting absorbed nutrients and lipids. The <strong>epithelial layer</strong> that covers the villi is primarily made up of <strong>enterocytes</strong>, which are specialized for absorption, and <strong>goblet cells</strong>, which secrete mucus to lubricate the intestinal contents.</p>
      
      <h5>Function</h5>
      <p>The primary function of intestinal villi is to facilitate the absorption of nutrients. As digested food passes through the small intestine, the villi increase the contact surface area with the intestinal contents, allowing for more efficient uptake of nutrients such as amino acids, sugars, and fatty acids. The absorbed nutrients enter the <strong>bloodstream</strong> via the capillaries or are absorbed into the lymphatic system through the lacteals. The villi also play a role in maintaining the mucosal barrier and immune response within the gut.</p>
      
      <h5>Clinical Significance</h5>
      <p>Damage or reduction in the number and function of intestinal villi can lead to significant health issues. Conditions such as <strong>celiac disease</strong>, <strong>Crohn's disease</strong>, and <strong>tropical sprue</strong> can cause villous atrophy or inflammation, impairing nutrient absorption and leading to malabsorption syndromes. Diagnosis often involves biopsy and histological examination to assess villous structure and function.</p>
      
      <h5>Development and Regeneration</h5>
      <p>Intestinal villi are constantly undergoing renewal. The epithelial cells of the villi have a high turnover rate, with new cells arising from <strong>intestinal crypts</strong> at the base of the villi. This continuous process of cell division and differentiation ensures the maintenance of the villous structure and function throughout an individual's life.</p>

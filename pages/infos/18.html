      <p>Blood vessels are an integral part of the circulatory system, playing a crucial role in the transportation of blood throughout the body. They ensure the delivery of oxygen, nutrients, and other essential substances to tissues and organs, while also facilitating the removal of waste products.</p>
      
      <h5>Types of Blood Vessels</h5>
      <p>There are three main types of blood vessels: <strong>arteries</strong>, <strong>veins</strong>, and <strong>capillaries</strong>. Each type has a unique structure and function, tailored to its role in the circulatory system.</p>
      
      <h5>Arteries</h5>
      <p><strong>Arteries</strong> carry blood away from the heart. They have thick, elastic walls that can withstand high pressure as the heart pumps blood into them. The largest artery in the body is the aorta, which branches into smaller arteries that supply blood to various parts of the body. Arteries further branch into arterioles, which regulate blood flow into capillary networks.</p>
      
      <h5>Veins</h5>
      <p><strong>Veins</strong> return blood to the heart. Unlike arteries, veins have thinner walls and often contain valves that prevent the backflow of blood. This is essential for maintaining blood flow in the correct direction, especially in the lower extremities where blood must travel against gravity to return to the heart. The largest veins in the body are the superior and inferior vena cavae, which bring deoxygenated blood back to the heart.</p>
      
      <h5>Capillaries</h5>
      <p><strong>Capillaries</strong> are the smallest and most numerous blood vessels, forming extensive networks that penetrate nearly every tissue. Their thin walls, composed of a single layer of endothelial cells, facilitate the exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste products between blood and surrounding tissues. This exchange is critical for maintaining cellular function and homeostasis.</p>
      
      <h5>Structure of Blood Vessel Walls</h5>
      <p>Blood vessel walls are composed of three layers: the <strong>tunica intima</strong>, <strong>tunica media</strong>, and <strong>tunica externa</strong>. The <strong>tunica intima</strong> is the innermost layer, consisting of endothelial cells that provide a smooth lining for blood flow. The <strong>tunica media</strong>, the middle layer, is made up of smooth muscle cells and elastic fibers, allowing vessels to regulate their diameter and thus control blood pressure and flow. The <strong>tunica externa</strong> is the outermost layer, providing structural support and protection with its connective tissue.</p>
      
      <h5>Function of Blood Vessels</h5>
      <p>Blood vessels play a critical role in maintaining circulatory function. They transport oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to tissues and return oxygen-poor blood to the lungs for reoxygenation. Additionally, they distribute nutrients absorbed from the digestive system, hormones released from glands, and cells involved in immune responses. The vascular system also helps regulate body temperature by controlling blood flow to the skin and aids in the removal of metabolic waste products through filtration processes in the kidneys.</p>
      
      <h5>Ruptured Blood Vessel</h5>
      <p>A <strong>ruptured blood vessel</strong> occurs when the wall of a blood vessel breaks, leading to bleeding either internally or externally. This can result from trauma, high blood pressure, or conditions that weaken the vessel wall such as aneurysms. Internal bleeding from a ruptured blood vessel can lead to serious complications, including hemorrhage, hematoma formation, and hypovolemic shock. Symptoms may include pain, swelling, and bruising in the affected area. Immediate medical attention is often required to control the bleeding and prevent further damage.</p>
